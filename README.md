In the manuscript, we used a mathematical model to describe the spread of RVF within and between 398 wards in Northern Tanzania, connected by cattle movements, on which we evaluated the impact of targeting vaccination using imperfect movement data. We show that pre-emptive vaccination guided by only market movement permit data is sufficient to prevent large outbreaks. Targeted control (either by the risk of RVF introduction or onward transmission) at any level of imperfect movement information is preferred over random vaccination, and any improvement in information reliability is advantageous to their effectiveness. 

## Data

The study exploits the multiplex network of cattle movements in Northern Tanzania generated by Chaters et al. (2019). The multiplex contains two layers: a movement network of cattle through markets, and a network connecting adjacent wards. In the first layer, used market movement permit data to generate a static network of cattle movements between 398 wards within three regions (Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Manyara) in Northern Tanzania, where the number of cattle moved is based on the estimates of the number moved in a month. The study defined a ward as an administrative unit of a mean area $243 \ \text{km}^2$ containing a mean human population of $12\ 000$ and a mean cattle population of $9\ 000$ across all $398$ wards. 

The market permit data were collected as part of the SEEDZ (Social, Economic and Environmental Drivers of Zoonoses in Tanzania) project. This dataset belongs to the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries of Tanzania, and we do not have permission to share it publicly. This also applies to the data on the number of cattle in each ward.

## Code

ALl codes, including network generation, the metapopulation model simulation, visualisations were performed in R. The script sim.funtions.R contains all major functions, which were source for in the sim.exploration.R script.
